# Forced Oscillations
## Summary

First lab experiment from my first year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester.
All data analysis was done in Excel so no .py files are included.

The aim of this experiment was to investigate the resonant frequency of a phosphor bronze bar under different conditions to confirm simple harmonic motion theory.

## Technical Highlights

* Data visualisation in Excel
* Linear Regression in Excel
* Chi-Square Analysis

## Files
* Forced Oscillations Lab Script.pdf contains a brief outline of the experiment given to me before I started.
* Forced Oscillations Lab Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including a schematic diagram, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions.
* Forced Oscillations Report.pdf contains my written lab report on the experiment.
