First lab experiment from my first year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester.
All data analysis was done in excel so no .py files are included.

* Forced Oscillations Prelab.pdf contains all introductory material given to me before I started the experiment.
* Forced Oscillations Lab Script.pdf contains a breif outline of the experiment given to me before I started.
* Forced Oscillations Lab Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including a schematic diagram, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions.
* Forced Oscillations Report.pdf contains my written up lab report from after the experiment.
